# Pelta
Pelta is a custom-built, full-stack community platform designed specifically for PlayStation enthusiasts. Moving away from generic forum templates, Pelta integrates a structured game database to enable seamless data referencing, cross-platform synchronization, and a modern discussion interface.

An independent PlayStation player community built upon the Delta (△) perspective symbol and Pelta (light shield) architectural concept.  It rejects existing forum frameworks and implements data referencing and multi-device synchronization from the ground up.
